# Drowsiness-Detection
Drowsy driving means operating a motor vehicle when a person is unable to remain alert due to lack of sleep. Drowsy driving is also known as sleep-deprived driving, fatigued driving, or tired driving. Driving in this state leads to slow, decreased reaction time and judgment of stimuli. In some cases, the driver may also fall asleep behind the wheel. Sleep deprivation is a major cause of motor vehicle accidents, and it can affect the human brain as much as alcohol can.

Facts on Drowsy Driving:
21 percent of all fatal accidents are due to drowsy driving
About 37 percent or 103 million people have fallen asleep at the wheel, according to the National Sleep Foundation’s [NSF] 2005 poll. 
4 percent or approximately eleven million drivers admit they have had an accident or near accident because they dozed off or were too tired to drive. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration[NHTSA] estimates that 100,000 accidents are the direct result of driver fatigue each year. 
Vehicular crashes result in an estimated 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries, and 12.5 billion dollars in monetary losses each year.
